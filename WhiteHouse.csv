I’m in my early 60’s never ever in my life have I ever take anything and not paid for it and never been in trouble. Yet today I have never been treated so badly and yes I paid you to do it to me by shopping in your store and putting profits in your till which I have done for years as a loyal customer . Aldi repays all shoppers by demanding and it was a demand to see in my shopping bags . Making me feel like a criminal, degrading this was absolutely humiliating no one in front of me or after me was asked to do it . When I complained I was informed all stores are going to be doing it if not doing so already . Then I said well ask everyone in the store then . Answer they are supposed to do so - so you are all in for the experience I have gone through if you shop in Aldi. Whatever happen to innocent until proven guilty??? Do they not realise how they are making people feel , that said yes it’s their right to do this after all it’s their shop, their rules if you shop in there. I had not heard anything about what they were doing until it happened to me. But maybe as people decide to shop in supermarkets that treat you like the decent people majority of people are and it hits their profits - well then they may realise just how much people do not like what they are doing. This could be there downfall I hope not please reconsider Aldi .All customers spending money in your supermarkets deserve better than decent prices and appalling treatment."
